## Wedding Videography Business Project
This project aims to provide valuable insights into revenue trends, employee activity, popular wedding video packages and other key metrics 
through a series of complex SQL queries.

Note: *Data was created by a randomizer. No data was taken from a real wedding videography business.*

To view both the query outputs and code, open SQL_outputs_wedding_business.pdf

The queries executed include the following:

1. Calculate total revenue by month for the latest year
2. Calculate total revenue for each package type over the past 12 months
3. Identify videographers who shot the most weddings for each of the past 3 years
4. Compare the number of weddings held in Q1 (January-March) and Q4 (October-December) for each year
5. Identify the month with the most weddings for each year
6. For each year, find the month with the highest and lowest number of bookings, along with the average package price for each month
7. Show email, phone number, full name, and wedding date for clients with Florida or Pennsylvania weddings
8. Identify the most popular wedding video package for each year 
9. Identify the month with the highest MoM increase for each year
